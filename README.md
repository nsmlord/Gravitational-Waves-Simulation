# Gravitational-Waves-Simulation  

## Overview  
This project simulates relativistic spatial phenomena and weak-field approximated gravitational waves. Using numerical methods and computational physics techniques, the simulation explores how gravitational waves propagate and interact with their environment under weak-field approximations of general relativity.

## Project Structure  

- **`source/`** – Contains the source code for the simulation, implementing the numerical models and visualization tools.  
- **`results/`** – Stores generated images and visualizations from the simulation, showcasing gravitational wave propagation and other relevant outputs.  
- **`SLRSPWAGW Documentation/`** – Includes a research paper discussing the theoretical background, methodologies, and findings related to the simulation of relativistic spatial phenomena and weak-field gravitational waves.

## Usage  
To run the simulation, navigate to the `source/` directory and execute the appropriate scripts. The results will be stored in the `results/` directory for further analysis.
